<p>We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage.</p>
<p>We tell ourselves that <a href="#">our life will be complete</a> when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire. The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges.</p>
<h3>Content Notes</h3>
<p class="note-general">It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred D Souza.</p>

<p>This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have. And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time&#8230; and remember that time waits for no one&#8230;</p>
